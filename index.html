<section id="introduction">
<p>I'm a software engineer who is committed to learning and improving their craft.
From a young age I have been passionate about all things related to technology and software and as I have grown so has my passion.</p>
<p>In my younger years I wanted to make Games. And after I finished secondary school I went on to do a course in Video Games development. During this time I realised that I had more interest in making software than games. So decided to get my degree in Computer Science.</p>
<p>Later I worked full time in the e-learning industry making single page applications on demand for a variety of clients.
Currently I work for 888sport where I am being given many opportunities to work with many newer web technologies.</p>
<p>In October 2017 I enrolled as a full-time student for 18 months at GenkiJACS school in Fukuoka to improve my Japanese language skill as much as possible and while there I succeeded in passing the JLPT N3 examination.</p>
<p>I really enjoy programming and learning new technologies and as a hobby I make small projects for myself. Usually these are to make my life easier in work or study but sometimes my goal is to learn something new.</p>
