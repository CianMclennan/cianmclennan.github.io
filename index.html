<section id="introduction">
<p>I'm an engineering team lead and software developer with over a decade of experience building high-quality web applications.</p>
<p>From a young age I have been passionate about all things related to technology and software, and as I've grown, so has my enthusiasm for empowering others through great tooling and automation.</p>
<p>In my younger years I wanted to make games. After finishing secondary school I completed a course in video game development. During this time I realised I had more interest in making software than games, and later earned a degree in Computer Science.</p>
<p>My professional background spans e-learning, SaaS, and sports betting platforms. I’ve built internal tooling for instructional designers, helped launch CMSs and frontend apps for high-traffic betting sites, and worked across the stack using technologies like React, Redux Toolkit, TypeScript, PostgreSQL, Docker, and AWS Lambda. I place strong focus on accessibility, clean code, and developer experience.</p>
<p>In October 2017 I enrolled as a full-time student for 18 months at GenkiJACS in Fukuoka to improve my Japanese. While there I passed the JLPT N3.</p>
<p>I enjoy programming and learning new technologies. I regularly build small tools and automations to make work more efficient or to try out something new.</p>
<p>More recently, I've taken an interest in AI and natural language interfaces and how they can help users and teams work more effectively.</p>
<p>Currently I work as Engineering Team Lead at iheed, an e-learning company that trains doctors and nurses.</p>
